# Blockchain Based E Voting System

## Design Consideration

The following considerations should be made when introducing an e-voting system:
1. Only registered voters should be authenticated by the e-voting system, which should verify their identity.
2. Invalid candidates should not be allowed access to the e-voting scheme.
3. Every voter should have only one vote, and the system should prevent double voting.
4. Voters should have full anonymity, and their votes should not be traceable.
5. It should not encourage someone to tamper with the votes cast.
6. The system should not allow counting to be controlled by a single authority.
